# SmartDoorLock
The project proposes the implementation of a smart door locking system, remotely controlled and integrated into an IoT architecture based on the MQTT protocol. The system allows:

• Control of the closing and opening of an electric lock

• Local authentication via keyboard, RFID or PIN code

• Monitoring the door status (closed/open)

• Real-time notifications to the user and/or application

• Archiving events in a database.

This type of system is useful in residential buildings, offices, warehouses or industrial spaces where access needs to be controlled and monitored.
